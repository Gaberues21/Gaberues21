# About me

I am a third-year PhD student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Manchester. My main research interests are acoustics, wave mechanics, and wave propagation in complex materials such as composites and metamaterials.

- I recieved an Undergraduate Degree in Engineering Sciences at the University Austral of Chile on 2021. Two years later I completed my MSc in Physics, especifically in Acoustics and Vibrations, at the same university. During the development of bachelor and master I started researching acoustic wave propagation in complex media, particularly porous composites and metamaterials with resonant units comprised of resonators and flexible membranes. This work entail deriving effective properties of such complex materials by means of mathematical methods such as the two-scale asymptotic method of homogenisation. Moreover, for my Master's thesis I built and measured the absorption properties of composites and metamaterials including heat sources. 

- For my PhD, I’m currently working on effective descriptions of acoustic and elastic wave propagation in complex media, particularly layered media, and how we can bridge the two usually indepedent effective descriptions. For this work, I've had to learn about the physics of elastic wave propagation, as well as relevant mathematical tools such as complex analysis and upscaling techniques.

In the repositories of my account, you can find several of the research projects I've worked on, including descriptions of the theory and results, as well as the codes employed to develop them. I have been mainly coding in MATLAB, but to ensure open access to my codes I've decided to rewrite them all in Python for the purpose of uploading them to GitHub.

If you are interested in similar topics as mine or if you would like to ask me any questions about any of the contents of my repositories please feel free to contact me.
